In this assignment we will be writing methods to manipulate arrays.

1. Create a 1D fixed-size array of 10 numbers.

2. Write a method called print which takes an array as input and prints the contents of the array.

3. Write a method called sum which takes an array as input and returns the sum of all the elements in the array.

4. Write a method called average which takes an array as input and returns the average of the values.

5. Write a method called max which takes an array as input and returns the max value in the array.

6. Write a method called min which takes an array as input and returns the max value in the array.

7. Write a method called sort which takes an array as input and returns the sorted array.

Do NOT use any library functions (like sort(), max(), contains(), etc.). You must write your own!
